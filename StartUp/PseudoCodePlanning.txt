                // Knowing the dimensions of the piece, it will be calculated how much material it needs for each piece and which cuts/procedures are nescessary to achieve the final product

                    // With the procedures needs known, the information will be ran trhough each (provider) companies information table, to know if they are able to produce the target amount and how much it will costs

                                // And based on their raw material stock, they will be informed if they can produce all of it or if they will need to order more and give them the option to order through the app

                        // If their order is accepted that piece will be added to the Client's and Provider's Currently in Productions Page and Schdeule Page
