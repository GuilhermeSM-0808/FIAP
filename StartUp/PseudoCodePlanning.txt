            // If he wants to register his company he will be asked wheter he is a provider or buyer, as well to provide legal documents as proof for the company's existance

                // If he is a provider he will be asked to list all Machinery the company posseses and optionally all the raw materail he has in stock (so the app can figure out what piece that copmapny can produce and how much based on stock)

                // He will also be given the option to provide their "Orçamento" (budget) excel or estimate/planning programm/costs

                // He will be asked some more cost related questions to figure out what his "Orçamento"/budgeting should be, like rent/IPTU, employees salaries and target profit marging is

            // The Drawing will be ran through Computer Vision to analyze the drawing and figure out the dimensions of the piece

                // Knowing the dimensions of the piece, it will be calculated how much material it needs for each piece and which cuts/procedures are nescessary to achieve the final product

                    // With the procedures needs known, the information will be ran trhough each (provider) companies information table, to know if they are able to produce the target amount and how much it will costs

                        // Then a List with many different companies will be shown with information on costs, distance, production rate/capacity, materials in stock and reviews in relevance order (Lowest cost first, shortest distance, highest production rate/capaticty and etc)

                        // Then the user is able to choose a company or split the order between two companies (in case they dont meet the production capacity). And send a order/request of production

                            // The company receiving the requests will be provided with their very own "Orçamento", production procedures needed and based on their information they can choose to accept or not the order/request

                        // If their order is accepted that piece will be added to the Client's and Provider's Currently in Productions Page and Schdeule Page

                            // Whether payment is made before or after production will be based on the provider company's preference

                        // If their order is denied they will be given the option to send the order/request to another company (they should be allowed to choose a secondary company to automatically send a new order in case the first denies it)
